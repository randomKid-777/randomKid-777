o-  Hi, I’m @randomKid-777
-  I’m interested in websites, raspberry pi, old imacs, python, 3d printing, and linux ...
-  I’m currently learning everything im interested in, specially python and websites/html/css
-  I’m looking to collaborate on raspberry pi and websites
-  Will add an email once im 13
-  Pronouns: he/him 
- Fun fact: im not even 13yo yet, but I needed a place to put my files and git clone them to my pi zero 2 w-powered imac shaped computer w/ piOS bullseye and a 2inch waveshare screen
- IMPORTANT- this is both a place to publish my files and a place for young people who like code (html/css/java/python/linux/c) to learn
